/**
 * Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest
 * number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password
 * must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.
 * <p/>
 * In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg, is not; it contains no instances of b, but
 * needs at least 1. The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within the limits of
 * their respective policies.
 * <p/>
 * How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
